## Potential issues

1. **Resolution**
    Not sure about the game resolution on different computers. There are two definitions for letter_rois_relative where the letters get a box to find them easier. If letters are incorrect
    you can check the debug_roi*.png files. These should contain perfekt letters, if not modify the values until the letters are in the pictures.

2. **Start buttons**
    Some popups are made in the begining, these are not handled. Either manually fix some levels or screenshot the button and place in collect_buttons folder.

3. **Commercial**
    Not all exit commercial picture are added, or they might be changed. Take a screenshot of the button that should exit the commercial, add it in reklam folder and re-run the script.

4. **Missing words**
    There are not that many good word lists. If a word is missing please add it to words.txt and.

## Improvements

1. It should be possible to use the different game_area_templates to get correct letter amount instead of dumb letter_rois_relative test. 
2. Some commercial are pressed and play store is opened. It should be possible to do a function to return to the game. I have only seen commercials fail once and then work.
3. Increase speed with less sleep or some advanced usage of the result crossword play area.
