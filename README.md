## Disclamer

1. **First levels**
    The first levels are not automated. These needs to be played until 5 letter game areas are used. This is level 18 i think.

2. **Commercial**
    Not all exit commercial picture are added, or they might be changed. Take a screenshot of the button that should exit the commercial, add it in reklam folder and re-run the script.
